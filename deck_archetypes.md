# Arcana Deck Archetypes (Set 1)

This document describes each of the included starter decks in `included_decks/`. Every deck is legal under the standard Set 1 construction rules: 19 rituals + 21 non-rituals for 40 cards total, with deck-specific copy caps. For each archetype below you will find its ritual curve, non-ritual payload, core game plan, key synergies, and principal weaknesses.

Unless otherwise noted, the win condition is reaching **20 match power** before the opponent. The alternate win (opponent decks out) only matters for the mill-heavy archetypes.

## 1. Incantations

**Ritual curve**: 7/6/3/3 (1s/2s/3s/4s)
**Non-rituals**: 4x Seek 2, 4x Insight 2, 4x Burn 2, 4x Woe 3, 2x Revive 2, 2x Renew 3, 1x Wrath 4
**Nobles / Temples / Rings**: none

### Game plan
A pure spellslinger that commits almost nothing to the field beyond rituals. The curve is heavily weighted toward the 2-lane so most non-rituals are castable off a single active 2R. The deck aims to convert Seek/Insight into reliable draws, erode the opponent's hand with Woe 3, and mill with Burn 2 while using Revive 2 to replay any of those incantations from crypt for a second pass; Renew 3 wants a 3-lane, Wrath 4 wants a 4-lane.

### Key synergies
- Revive 2 effectively doubles the Woe/Burn/Seek/Insight payload once the crypt fills up (Renew 3 pulls rituals from crypt instead).
- The single Wrath 4 is the only disruption against opposing ritual boards; save it for a lane the opponent actually needs (usually their 3-lane for Woe or their 4-lane for Wrath mirror).
- A 1R + 2R open runs most of the deck; the 2-lane gates Revive 2; the 3-lane gates Woe 3 and Renew 3; the 4-lane gates Wrath 4.

### Weaknesses
- No nobles, temples, or rings means no ceiling beyond raw ritual power. Reaching 20 match power depends entirely on resolving rituals.
- No Dethrone, so opposing Power-Nobles or Yytzr/Zytzr are unanswerable.
- Weak to Wrath 4 from opponents — losing the 2R lane turns the deck off entirely.

## 2. Noble Test

**Ritual curve**: 6/5/5/3
**Non-rituals**: 4x Seek 1, 4x Seek 2, 4x Dethrone 4, 1x Serraf (Ring of Nobles), and **the full noble cast** — Krss, Trss, Yrss (Power 2/3/4 lane-granters), plus all five Incantation-nobles (Sndrr, Indrr, Bndrr, Wndrr, Rndrr).

### Game plan
A tutor/toolbox deck designed to exercise every noble in Set 1. Play a Power-noble early to unlock a lane for free, then chain Incantation-nobles whose activated abilities provide repeatable Seek/Insight/Burn/Woe/Revive effects each turn. Serraf reduces every noble to effective cost N-1, making a turn-1 Krss or turn-2 Trss realistic.

### Key synergies
- **Serraf + any noble** — essentially one-lane-cheaper deployment across the whole 8-noble suite.
- **Power-noble stacking** — Krss (grants 1), Trss (grants 2), Yrss (grants 3) stack their static lane grants, so the deck can project ritual power from nobles alone.
- **Dethrone 4 x4** is unusually heavy, reflecting that the mirror plan against opposing nobles is also the plan here: clear their board before they stack static value.

### Weaknesses
- Extremely noble-dependent. Wrath 4 / Dethrone 4 exchanges against a disruption deck gut the strategy quickly.
- Only 9 incantations total (8 Seek + 4 Dethrone); card velocity is driven almost entirely by noble activations, which require those nobles to survive a turn.
- Cannot revive nobles, so each removed noble is permanently down.

---

## 3. Wrathseek-Sac

**Ritual curve**: 5/5/9/0 (no 4s — maxed-out 3-ritual stack)
**Non-rituals**: 4x Seek 1, 4x Seek 2, 4x Insight 3, 4x Wrath 4, 4x Revive 2, 1x Sndrr

### Game plan
A sacrifice-based control/tempo deck. With zero 4-rituals in the list, Wrath 4 is never paid via lane — it is always paid by sacrificing 3-rituals (or a 1+2, etc.). Nine value-3 rituals guarantee a fat 3-lane that both fuels Wrath sacrifices and enables Insight 3 and Revive 2. Seek 1/2 cycle to find Wrath targets, Revive 2 recurs anything already used.

### Key synergies
- **3R glut + Wrath 4**: sacrificing one 3-ritual pays for a Wrath and still nets the opponent only 1 draw back; the user loses 3 ritual power but usually removes 3+ on the opposing side.
- **Revive 2 + Wrath 4** is the key engine — recasting buried Wraths from crypt turns this into an almost infinite-removal deck as long as the 2-lane stays live for Revive 2 and there are 3-rituals to sacrifice.
- **Sndrr** (discard-to-Seek 1) smooths draws late when the hand runs dry.

### Weaknesses
- No 4-lane means Wrath always costs a ritual — every removal shrinks the user's own board.
- No Dethrone, Burn, or noble removal, so opposing nobles simply run the deck over.
- Vulnerable to mirror Wrath; losing the 3-lane is catastrophic.

---

## 4. Ritual Reanimator

**Ritual curve**: 6/4/4/5
**Non-rituals**: 4x Burn 1, 4x Burn 2, 4x Burn 3, 1x Burn 4, 3x Insight 2, 3x Revive 2, 1x Aeoiu (Scion of Rituals), 1x Phaedra (Temple of Illusion)

### Game plan
A mill/reanimation hybrid. The curve is barbell-shaped (lots of 1s and 4s) to both guarantee early Burn pressure and sacrifice-fuel for Phaedra (cost 7). Aeoiu's activated ability lets the deck replay one ritual per turn from crypt, pairing with Burn spells that mill into the crypt and Phaedra's Insight+draw to fix the top of the deck.

### Key synergies
- **Aeoiu + crypt** — self-milling via Burn fills the crypt, and Aeoiu pulls any value ritual back each turn, effectively nullifying sacrifice costs for Phaedra, Wrath, etc. This is the primary value engine.
- **Phaedra + Insight stack** — Phaedra's Insight-then-draw plus dedicated Insight 2 cards manipulate the top of the deck to control what the next turn draws.
- **Burn 3 / Burn 4** double as opponent-mill win condition and as self-mill fuel for Aeoiu.

### Weaknesses
- No nobles aside from Aeoiu and no ritual-lane grants — if Aeoiu is Dethroned, the reanimation plan collapses.
- Phaedra is the only temple and costs 7; if discarded or milled it's gone (temples cannot be revived).
- No Wrath, Woe, or Dethrone — zero opposing-board removal.

## 5. Topheavy Annihilator

**Ritual curve**: 3/4/4/8 (almost maxed on 4-rituals)
**Non-rituals**: 4x Wrath 4, 4x Burn 4, 4x Insight 4, 4x Dethrone 4, 4x Seek 2, 1x Zytzr (Noble of Annihilation)

### Game plan
Aggressive high-lane removal/burst. With eight 4-rituals the deck almost always has lane 4 available, so every piece of removal and every Burn 4 can be fired off-lane without sacrifice. Seek 2 is the only cheap draw. Zytzr is the capstone: it grants +1 ritual destroyed on every Wrath (so Wrath hits 2) and +1 discard on Woe — but this deck carries no Woe, leveraging only the Wrath boost.

### Key synergies
- **Zytzr + Wrath 4** — Wrath destroys **2** opposing rituals instead of 1 while Zytzr is on the field. Against a ritual-heavy opponent this is a runaway swing.
- **4-lane saturation** — lanes 1-3 are deliberately thin; opponents relying on Wrath 4 still need to sacrifice to pay, while this deck plays Wrath/Burn/Dethrone on-lane for free.
- **Burn 4 + Insight 4** as a late alternate-win package: 11 mill per Burn 4 cast (or 14 with Yytzr, not run here) plus top-deck sculpting.

### Weaknesses
- Extremely fragile lane ladder. One Wrath on a 1-, 2-, or 3-ritual can deactivate lane 4 entirely (a 4-ritual is only active if 1/2/3 are each active).
- Only one noble; if Zytzr is Dethroned, Wrath reverts to single-target.
- No revive, no temples, no rings — no recovery tools if the early game is disrupted.

---

## 6. Occultation

**Ritual curve**: 5/5/5/4
**Non-rituals**: 2x Burn 1, 2x Burn 2, 2x Burn 3, 2x Burn 4, 4x Revive 2, 4x Renew 3, 2x Dethrone 4, 1x Yytzr (Noble of Occultation), 1x Aeoiu (Scion of Rituals), 1x Cymbil (Ring of Occultation)

### Game plan
A mill-win deck built around Yytzr's static ability: "Your Burn mills +3". The curve is an even 5/5/5/4 spread so every Burn value can be cast on-lane. Cymbil reduces Burn and Revive by 1, turning Burn 1 into a free 1-lane-is-always-active mill and Revive 2 into a 1-lane cast; Renew 3 becomes a 2-lane cast. Aeoiu recycles rituals from the crypt as the deck self-mills, keeping lanes live.

### Key synergies
- **Yytzr + Burn** — every Burn mills an extra 3 cards. Burn 4 then mills 11, and Yytzr's optional Revive-extension sacrifices rituals to stack extra Revive steps on top.
- **Cymbil + Burn 1** — a cost-0 Burn castable with no lane required; repeatedly recurable via Revive 2.
- **Aeoiu + self-mill** — Burn also dumps your own rituals if paid via sacrifice; Aeoiu brings them back for free.
- **Dethrone 4 x2** protects Yytzr from being out-noble'd.

### Weaknesses
- Eight Burns plus eight Revive/Renew copies but no Seek or Insight → weak card selection and vulnerable to flooding on rituals.
- Losing Yytzr roughly halves the deck's mill output.
- No defensive answers to opposing Woe/Wrath beyond Dethrone 4.

---

## 7. Annihilation

**Ritual curve**: 6/4/4/5
**Non-rituals**: 4x Wrath 4, 4x Woe 3, 4x Woe 4, 4x Dethrone 4, 1x Seek 2, 1x Zytzr, 1x Wndrr, 1x Tmrsk (Scion of Annihilation), 1x Celadon (Ring of Annihilation)

### Game plan
A dedicated hand-and-board-disruption deck. Every non-ritual (except one Seek) attacks the opponent's hand, rituals, or nobles. Zytzr boosts every Wrath to hit 2 rituals and every Woe to force one extra discard. Wndrr offers a repeatable discard-for-Woe-3 engine each turn. Tmrsk chains a free Woe 3 after each Wrath.

### Key synergies
- **Zytzr + Wrath + Woe** — flat static buff to the deck's entire non-ritual suite (12 of 21 spells).
- **Tmrsk + Wrath 4** — cast Wrath, then automatically Woe 3; with Zytzr on field, Wrath destroys 2 rituals and Woe discards 2 cards. This is an absurd single-turn swing.
- **Wndrr** — repeatable discard -> Woe 3 each turn, self-fueling from the Woe 4 cards in hand the deck can't always cast yet.
- **Celadon** drops Woe 3 to lane 2 and Wrath 4 to lane 3, easing the 4-lane requirement in the early game.

### Weaknesses
- Only 1 Seek and no Insight/Revive means card velocity is poor; topdecks must matter.
- Needs active 3-lane and 4-lane quickly; disruptive opening hands that lack a 2R or 3R stall the plan.
- Depends heavily on Zytzr-as-multiplier; losing it significantly dampens output.

## 8. Emanation

**Ritual curve**: 6/5/4/4
**Non-rituals**: 3x Seek 1, 4x Seek 2, 3x Insight 1, 3x Insight 2, 4x Insight 3, 1x Dethrone 4, 1x Rmrsk (Scion of Emanation), 1x Sndrr (Noble of Incantation), 1x Sybiline (Ring of Emanation)

### Game plan
A card-velocity / draw-engine deck. Seek and Insight together are 17 cards of the 21-card non-ritual slot. Rmrsk lets the player draw 1 after each Insight resolves, turning every Insight 1 / Insight 2 / Insight 3 into effectively an extra draw on top of the deck-sculpt. Sybiline reduces all Seek/Insight by 1, so Seek 2 and Insight 2 become free on-lane at 1, and Insight 3 becomes castable at lane 2.

### Key synergies
- **Rmrsk + Insight** — after every Insight, optionally draw 1. With 10 Insights in the deck this is a repeating +1 card engine.
- **Sybiline + Seek/Insight** — cost reduction plus Rmrsk's trigger makes a single 1R into an engine that churns through the deck.
- **Sndrr** — once-per-turn discard-for-Seek 1 adds more filtering and hand depth.

### Weaknesses
- Only 1 piece of interaction (a single Dethrone 4). Against heavy disruption (Woe/Wrath/Zytzr decks) the deck runs out of threats and wins only by raw ritual count.
- No temples, no removal of rituals/birds, no revive.
- Empty-deck loss is a real risk — heavy self-draw plus incidental opposing Burn can deck the player out.

---

## 9. Scions

**Ritual curve**: 7/5/4/3
**Non-rituals**: 4x Woe 3, 4x Burn 2, 4x Seek 2, 1x Insight 2, 4x Wrath 4, 1x Rmrsk, 1x Smrsk (Scion of Occultation), 1x Tmrsk (Scion of Annihilation), 1x Serraf (Ring of Nobles)

### Game plan
A cost-2 scion toolbox: every scion in the Set 1 lineup is a cost-2 noble with an optional trigger after resolving a specific verb. With Serraf, every scion drops to an effective cost of 1, so a single 1R turn enables all three. The spell mix is chosen so each scion has triggers to fire from the main deck's payload — Rmrsk off Insight, Smrsk off Burn/Revive (the deck runs Burn 2 x4), Tmrsk off Wrath 4 x4.

### Key synergies
- **Tmrsk + Wrath 4** — each Wrath optionally chains a Woe 3, compounding disruption.
- **Smrsk + Burn 2** — after a Burn, optionally sacrifice a ritual of value X to Burn yourself X. This is niche self-mill for future Revive lines (though the deck runs no Revive — interpret as an optional Burn-mirror if drawing dead rituals).
- **Rmrsk + Insight 2** — small but real, one extra draw from the single Insight.
- **Serraf** discounts every scion, making a three-scion board realistic by mid-game.

### Weaknesses
- No temples, no Dethrone, no Revive. Scions are cost-2 and fragile.
- Smrsk's self-Burn trigger is risky without a Revive plan; it's really here for the archetype completeness.
- Reliant on Serraf staying in play; if the only ring is Dethroned (via host loss) or never drawn, tempo suffers.

---

## 10. Temples

**Ritual curve**: 6/5/4/4
**Non-rituals**: 5x Seek 1, 4x Seek 2, 4x Insight 1, 4x Insight 2, plus **all four Set 1 temples** — Phaedra (7), Delpha (7), Gotha (7), and Ytria (9).

### Game plan
A pure temple-toolbox deck: find a big ritual board, then slam every temple. Cheap Seek/Insight fills the hand and finds sacrifice fodder; Ytria at cost 9 is the sacrificial capstone that dumps the hand to redraw the same number. Delpha recurs rituals from crypt to keep lanes active after temple sacrifices drain the field. Gotha's discard-for-draw activation converts dead-in-hand rituals and spells into fresh cards.

### Key synergies
- **Ytria + a full hand** — discard 7, draw 7. Best cast after Seek/Insight has filled the hand.
- **Delpha + high-value ritual** — sacrifice a 4R to abyss, Burn self 4 (mill fuel), then pull a different ritual from crypt. Net: lose a 4R, gain a ritual, 8 cards milled for a future Revive deck (though this deck has no Revive — the mill is incidental).
- **Gotha** can discard an unused 4R to draw 4 — devastating value.
- **Phaedra's** Insight-then-draw smooths out every draw step.

### Weaknesses
- Temples each cost 7 or 9 in ritual sacrifices — casting them deactivates the player's own lanes. Needs active Delpha (or redundancy) to refill.
- No removal, no nobles, no Revive. Opposing nobles go entirely unanswered.
- Expensive setup: a temple-heavy opening hand is nearly uncastable until turn 4+.

---

## 11. Bird Test

**Ritual curve**: 7/5/4/3
**Non-rituals**: 4x Sparrow (cost 2 / power 1), 4x Raven (cost 4 / power 3), 1x Hawk (4/3), 1x Gull (3/2), 4x Seek 2, 3x Insight 2, 1x Sndrr, 1x Phaedra, 1x Eyrie (Temple of Feathers), 1x Sinofia (Ring of Feathers)

### Game plan
A bird-tribal strategy leveraging both bird match-power (+1 per wild bird, +1 extra per nested) and bird combat. Sparrows are cheap board presence; Ravens are the power-3 beaters that dominate fights. Eyrie searches for a free bird on entry. Phaedra provides a nesting site (cost 7, so 7 birds can nest, each adding +1 ritual power). Sinofia reduces all birds and Tears by 1, making Sparrow a 1-lane bird and Raven a 3-lane bird.

### Key synergies
- **Eyrie + Bird search** — drop Eyrie, immediately search a bird for free. With 10 birds in the deck this almost never fizzles.
- **Phaedra + nesting** — any Phaedra in play lets birds nest, giving +1 ritual power per nested bird (stacking match-power and ritual power). Nesting shelters birds from the destruction step of opposing Deluge, but only for that single cast: Deluge's second clause un-nests every surviving bird, so the nest is a one-shot hedge rather than a permanent shield. Stacking two Deluges (or Deluge + bird-combat) cleans out even a full Phaedra.
- **Sinofia + Sparrow** — cost-1 Sparrow, cost-3 Raven. Nesting in Phaedra or Eyrie means "wearing a ring" is mutually exclusive with nesting, so Sinofia pays off on the birds who plan to fight rather than nest. Caveat: ringed birds stay wild and therefore remain exposed to Deluge 2 (Sparrow) / Deluge 4 (ringed Raven) on the first cast.
- **Raven swarm** — four 3-power birds win almost any bird-combat exchange; only Deluge 4 can touch them, and only while they're wild. Nested Ravens survive one Deluge 4 but then become wild, so a second copy closes the loop.

### Weaknesses
- No Tears/Dethrone, and the deck's own answer to opposing birds is bird-combat rather than Deluge — no cheap wipe of opposing wild swarms.
- Only 8 incantations total (Seek/Insight only), so card velocity is modest.
- Rings and birds interact poorly with the nest rule (ringed birds cannot nest, nested birds cannot be ringed), making board-building decisions constrained.

---

## 12. Void Temples

**Ritual curve**: 5/5/3/6
**Non-rituals**: 4x Void, 4x Seek 2, 4x Sparrow, 4x Gull (3/2), and **every Set 1 temple** (Phaedra, Delpha, Gotha, Eyrie, Ytria).

### Game plan
A defensive temple/bird combo: use Void reactively to counter opposing game-ending plays (temples, big incantations, nobles) while stacking one of every temple for a diverse midgame. The 4/6 ritual split heavy on 4s supports sacrificing into Ytria (9) and the 7-cost trio. Birds (8 of them) provide match-power and bird-combat threat, and Eyrie tutors more birds.

### Key synergies
- **Void + 4R pile** — Void's only cost is discarding one other card from hand. A deck with lots of castable Seek/Insight and cheap birds never lacks pitch fuel, so Voids are effectively "free" reactive counters.
- **Ytria + Void** — cast Ytria to refresh the hand, dumping spent Voids and drawing potentially fresh Voids.
- **Eyrie** pulls a bird straight onto the field for free, boosting match power on the same turn it enters. Eyrie and Phaedra also act as one-shot Deluge shelters — Sparrows (power 1) and Gulls (power 2) parked in a nest survive the destruction step, but Deluge's second clause un-nests them, so the shelter doesn't carry across multiple Deluges.
- **Gotha** discards a bird or ritual to draw equal-to-cost; with 4-cost Gulls (power 2) and cost-4 rituals, this draws 2-4 cards per activation.
- **Void + Deluge** — the stronger line against Deluge is to Void it outright rather than rely on nesting. A Voided Deluge never unnests anyone, so the Phaedra/Eyrie ritual-power bonus from nested birds stays intact.

### Weaknesses
- No nobles at all. No Wrath, no Woe, no Dethrone, no Burn — zero proactive disruption.
- Temples are singletons and cost 6-9; if opponent Woes them out of hand, they're gone.
- The deck leans on drawing Void at the right time; without it on a critical opposing play the deck lacks answers.

---

## 13. Revive

**Ritual curve**: 7/5/4/3
**Non-rituals**: 4x Seek 1, 4x Seek 2, 4x Insight 1, 4x Insight 2, 4x Revive 2, 1x Rndrr (Noble of Incantation)

### Game plan
An engine deck focused on recycling incantations from crypt. Most non-rituals are cost 1 or 2, so the deck opens on a 1R + 2R ladder, but Revive 2 needs the 2-lane online. Revive 2 is cast from hand to re-cast an eligible incantation from crypt (into abyss); Rndrr provides a once-per-turn free Revive 2, effectively doubling up on the most powerful Seek/Insight resolved so far.

### Key synergies
- **Rndrr + crypt full of Seek 2** — free extra Seek 2 every turn after a single Seek has been resolved.
- **Revive 2 + Insight 2** — cast an Insight 2 from crypt for a second helping of top-deck sculpting with the same ritual footprint.
- **Heavy 1-ritual base** (7x) keeps the ladder warm; the 2-lane must stay active for Revive 2 from hand, while Rndrr’s free Revive 2 does not consume a lane.

### Weaknesses
- No removal, no temples, no Wrath, no Dethrone — the deck has no board-impacting cards at all. Opposing nobles and rituals go unanswered.
- Revived cards go to abyss, so they cannot be looped a third time. The engine is finite.
- Flat ritual ceiling: with only 3x 4R and 4x 3R, pure ritual power tops out around 15-17; reaching 20 match power demands near-perfect draws.
