"""Pilot for the pure Revive-engine deck.

Every non-ritual is cost 1 or 2, so a 1R + 2R opener runs the entire
deck. Rndrr's free-Revive-2 activation every turn is the whole engine;
the base class already activates nobles whose effects score positively.
Revive targeting prefers the highest-value Seek/Insight (these decks
want to draw through the deck to stack rituals, not recur removal)."""
