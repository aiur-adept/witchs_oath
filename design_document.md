# Arcana Rules Reference (Set 1)

This document defines the complete game rules for Arcana as currently implemented.

## 1) Match Setup

- Two players each use a legal **40-card** deck.
- Determine starting player by any agreed random method (for example, a d20 challenge).
- Each player draws **5** cards.
- Each player may take **one** London mulligan:
  - Shuffle hand into deck.
  - Draw 5 new cards.
  - Put exactly 1 card from hand on the bottom of deck.
- After mulligans are complete, the starting player takes the first turn and performs the normal turn-start draw.

## 2) Zones

- **Deck**: face-down draw pile.
- **Hand**: private cards in hand.
- **Ritual Field**: your rituals in play.
- **Noble Field**: your nobles in play.
- **Temple Field**: your temples in play.
- **Crypt**: your discard pile; destroyed/sacrificed/discarded cards go here unless stated otherwise.
- **Abyss**: a separate pile for specific effects (primarily cards cast via Revive, and some temple costs).

## 3) Card Types

- **Ritual**: persistent card played to ritual field; contributes ritual power when active.
- **Incantation**: one-shot spell card played from hand, then put into crypt.
- **Noble**: persistent unit with static and/or activated/triggered abilities.
- **Temple**: persistent card played by sacrificing rituals; has once-per-turn activations.
- **Bird**: a supplemental unit type used for match points and bird combat.

## 4) Turn Structure

Each turn has three practical steps:

1. **Turn-start draw**
   - Active player draws 1 card.
   - Exception: if that player controls Gotha, they skip this draw.
2. **Main phase**
   - Active player may perform actions in any order, including:
     - Play any number of incantations (if legal and paid).
     - Play up to one ritual.
     - Play up to one noble.
     - Play up to one temple.
     - Perform one bird combat (optional, once per turn).
     - Activate eligible nobles (generally once each per turn).
     - Activate eligible temples (once each per turn).
     - Once per turn: discard one card to draw one card.
3. **End turn / hand cleanup**
   - Active player must discard down to **7** cards.
   - Then turn passes to opponent, who immediately starts their turn with turn-start draw.

## 5) Ritual Lanes and Active Rituals

Ritual values are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

- A **1-ritual is always active**.
- A ritual of value **N > 1** is active only if you also have at least one active ritual of every value from 1 to N-1.
- A ritual lane is active if you control at least one active ritual of that value.
- Birds can additionally activate one ritual lane: the lane whose value equals the total Bird power you control.

**Ritual power** is the sum of values of your active rituals only.
**Match power** equals your ritual power plus 1 for each Bird you control.

Example:

```
1 x 1R
2 x 2R
1 x 3R
2 x 4R
```

All are active, so ritual power is `1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 16`.

Bird lane example:

- If you control 1 x Bird 1, 1 x Bird 2, and 1 x Bird 3, the summed Bird power is 6, so your 6-lane is active from birds.

## 6A) Birds

### 6A.1 Cost and Power

- Birds have costs **2-4** and powers **1-3**.
- A Bird with cost **N** has power **N-1** (2->1, 3->2, 4->3).
- Each Bird you control adds **+1** to your match power.

### 6A.2 Lane Activation from Birds

- Sum the power of all Birds you currently control.
- The ritual lane matching that total is active (from birds) while that total remains unchanged.

### 6A.3 Bird Combat (once per turn)

- Once per turn during your main phase, you may choose any set of your Birds and any set of opponent Birds to fight.
- A chosen attacking set may target only one opposing Bird in that combat.
- Simultaneously, each chosen side deals damage equal to its total chosen Bird power to the opposing chosen side.
- Damage on each side is divided among that side's chosen Birds as that side's controller decides.
- After damage is assigned, each Bird that has damage greater than or equal to its power is discarded.

### 6A.4 Bird Nesting

- Birds have the ability nest. A temple on your field may nest X birds in it where X is its cost. 
- Each bird nested in a temple adds an additional +1 to ritual power and cannot be involved in fighting.
- An un-nested bird is "wild".

## 6) Playing Cards and Paying Costs

### 6.1 Incantations

To play an incantation of value **N**, you must either:

- Have active lane N, or
- Sacrifice rituals with total value at least N.

If sacrificed, those rituals leave your field and go to your crypt.

### 6.2 Nobles

To play a noble, you must have the noble's cost lane active (no sacrifice payment for noble play).
Only one noble may be played from hand per turn.

### 6.3 Temples

To play a temple, you must sacrifice rituals with total value at least its temple cost:

- Most temples cost **7**.
- Ytria costs **9**.

Only one temple may be played from hand per turn.

### 6.4 Dethrone

Dethrone has value 4.
To play Dethrone, you must either have active lane 4 or sacrifice rituals totaling at least 4.
It destroys one target opposing noble.

## 7) Action Limits and Timing Locks

- During your turn, you may play:
  - At most 1 ritual from hand.
  - At most 1 noble from hand.
  - At most 1 temple from hand.
  - At most 1 bird from hand.
  - Any number of incantations (as long as each is legal and payable)
- `Discard-for-draw` may be used once per turn.
- `Bird combat` may be used once per turn.
- Each noble/temple activation is once per turn per permanent.
- You cannot take further proactive actions while waiting for a required response to a pending effect you created (for example, opponent discard choice from Woe, or your own optional scion trigger decision).

## 8) Win and Draw Conditions

Game ends immediately when any of the following occurs:

1. A player reaches **20 or more match power**.
2. A player attempts to draw from an empty deck.

If empty-deck draw is attempted:

- Compare both players' current match power.
- Higher match power wins.
- Equal match power is a draw.

## 9) Core Mechanics (Set 1)

- **Seek X**: Draw X cards.
- **Insight X**: Look at top X cards of target player's deck; reorder any on top and/or move any number to bottom.
- **Burn X**: Mill `2 * X` cards from target player's deck into that player's crypt.
- **Woe X**: Target player discards X chosen cards from hand.
- **Wrath 4**: Destroy 2 opponent rituals.
- **Revive 1**: Cast 1 eligible incantation from your crypt.
  - Revive itself cannot be revived.
  - Wrath cannot be cast via revive.
  - Cards cast this way go to abyss (not crypt).
- **Dethrone 4**: Destroy one opposing noble.
- **Tears 3**: Return a Bird from your crypt to the field. 

## 10) Noble Abilities (Set 1)

All noble static abilities apply while that noble remains on the field.

  - Your Wrath destroys 1 extra ritual.
  - Your Woe forces 1 additional discard.
- **Aeoiu, Scion of Rituals** (activated, once per turn):

## 11) Temple Abilities (Set 1)

Temple activations are once per turn per temple.

### 11.1 Cost 6 temples

**Eyrie, Temple of Feathers**:
  - When this Temple enters, search your deck for two bird cards and put them onto your field, then shuffle your deck.

### 11.2 Cost 7 temples

- **Phaedra, Temple of Illusion**:
  - Insight 1, then draw 1.
- **Delpha, Temple of Oracles**:
  - Sacrifice one ritual of value X from field (it goes to abyss), then Burn yourself X, then play one ritual from your crypt.
  - Legal only if you have enough cards in deck to mill `2X`.
- **Gotha, Temple of Illness**:
  - Static: Skip your turn-start draw.
  - Activated: Discard one non-temple card, then draw cards equal to that card's value/cost.

### 11.3 Cost 9 temple

- **Ytria, Temple of Cycles**:
  - Discard your hand, then draw that many cards.

## 12) Clarifications and Edge Cases

- **Lane grants are static**: If a Noble of Power is on field, its granted lane is available continuously.
- **Woe with insufficient hand**: target discards as many as possible (up to required amount).
- **Wrath with too few enemy rituals**: destroys as many as possible, up to required amount.
- **Milling is not drawing**: Burn moving cards from deck to crypt does not trigger empty-deck loss by itself.
- **Empty deck loss check** only occurs when a player attempts to draw.
- **Revived cards to abyss**: an incantation cast via revive is placed in abyss after resolution; if a revived noble is later destroyed/dethroned, it goes to abyss.
- **Temples and nobles cannot be revived**: revive only works on incantations.

## 13) Deck Construction Rules

For legal deck construction:

- Base deck: exactly **19 Ritual** cards and **21 non-Ritual** cards (**40 cards total**).
- At most **9 rituals of any one value** (for example, no more than 9 copies of value-4 rituals).
- At most **4 copies** of any named incantation or bird card.
- At most **1 copy** of any named temple card.
- For nobles, at most **1** card per noble first name (for example, max 1 "Yrss").
